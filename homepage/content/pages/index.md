Offen is a web analytics software that gives users access to the data they are generating. Not only operators running sites or applications are given able to use the analytics tools, but also _the users themselves are granted access to and ownership of their data._

Usage metrics come with explanations about their meaning, relevance, usage and possible privacy implications. Offen also details _which kind of data is not collected._ All data can be deleted selectively or in its entirety by the users, or the collection can be disabled altogether.

Offen treats both users and operators as parties of equal importance. Users can expect full transparency and are encouraged to make _autonomous and informed decisions regarding the use of their data._ Operators are enabled to gain insights while respecting their users' privacy and data.

Offen is currently in the early stages of development and is applying for funds to sustain its development.
