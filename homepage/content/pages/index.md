<h2>Summary</h2>
<article>
<p>
Offen is a web analytics software that gives users access to the data they are generating. Not only operators running sites or applications are given able to use the analytics tools, but also <em>the users themselves are granted access to and ownership of their data.</em>
</p>
<p>
Usage metrics come with explanations about their meaning, relevance, usage and possible privacy implications. Offen also details <em>which kind of data is not collected.</em> All data can be deleted selectively or in its entirety by the users, or the collection can be disabled altogether.
</p>
<p>
Offen treats both users and operators as parties of equal importance. Users can expect full transparency and are encouraged to make <em>autonomous and informed decisions regarding the use of their data.</em> Operators are enabled to gain insights while respecting their users' privacy and data.
</p>
<p>
Offen is currently in the early stages of development and is applying for funds to sustain its development. An early alpha version is running on this site: you can <em>visit the <a class="link b dim gray" href="/auditorium/">auditorium</a></em> to access your data.
