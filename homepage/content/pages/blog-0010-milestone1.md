## Laying the foundation
What we achieved in the last 6 weeks

### *Application architecture*
extension by middleware
additional behavior can transparently be added by any consumer

### *Build*
We want offen to be easy to deploy, and also make it easy for people interested to give it a test drive.
compiled into a single binary file
you can now download a offen binary and execute it on your local machine to instantly have a (ephemeral) instance up and running.
Right now, this setup only supports Linux, but we are aiming to support Windows and MacOS just as well soon.
