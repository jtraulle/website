> The www.offen.dev website

This repository contains the source code for the <www.offen.dev> website, as well as the code needed for running and extending an instance of `offen/offen`.

---

### Developing the application

The development setup requires `docker` and `docker-compose` to be installed.

After cloning the repository, you can build the containers and install dependencies using:

```sh
$ make setup
```

Next seed the database for the `server` application:

```sh
$ make bootstrap
```

You can test your setup by starting the application:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

which should enable you to access the homepage at <http://localhost:8000/> and use the `auditorium` at <http://localhost:8000/>
