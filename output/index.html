<h2>
<strong>offen</strong> is a free analysis software for websites and web applications that allows a fair handling of data.
</h2>

<p><strong>offen</strong> is a web analytics software that <em>gives users access</em> to the data they are generating. Not only operators running sites or applications are given access to the <em>analytics tools,</em> but also the users themselves are granted access and <em>ownership regarding their data.</em></p>
<p>Usage <em>metrics come with explanations</em> about their meaning, relevance, usage and possible privacy implications. <strong>offen</strong> also details which kind of data is <em>not collected.</em> All data can be deleted selectively or in its entirety by the users or its <em>recording can be disabled</em> altogether.</p>
<p><strong>offen</strong> treats both users and operators as parties of <em>equal importance.</em> Users can expect full transparency and are encouraged to make <em>autonomous decisions</em> regarding the use of their data. Operators are enabled to <em>gain insights while dealing fairly</em> with user data.</p>
<p><strong>offen</strong> is currently in the concept phase and is applying for various development funds.</p>
