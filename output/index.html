<h2>
<strong>offen</strong> is a free and open source analytics software for websites and web applications that allows respectful handling of data.
</h2>

<p><strong>offen</strong> is a web analytics software that gives users access to the data they are generating. Not only operators running sites or applications are given able to use the analytics tools, but also <em>the users themselves are granted access to and ownership of their data</em>.</p>
<p>Usage metrics come with explanations about their meaning, relevance, usage and possible privacy implications. <strong>offen</strong> also details <em>which kind of data is not collected</em>. All data can be deleted selectively or in its entirety by the users, or the collection can be disabled altogether.</p>
<p><strong>offen</strong> treats both users and operators as parties of equal importance. Users can expect full transparency and are encouraged to make <em>autonomous and informed decisions regarding the use of their data</em>. Operators are enabled to gain insights while respecting their users' privacy and their data.</p>
<p><strong>offen</strong> is currently being conceptually designed and is applying for funds to sustain its development.</p>
