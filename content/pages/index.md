__offen__ is a web analytics software that *gives users access* to the data they are generating. Not only operators running sites or applications are given access to the *analytics tools,* but also the users themselves are granted access and *ownership regarding their data.*

Usage *metrics come with explanations* about their meaning, relevance, usage and possible privacy implications. __offen__ also details which kind of data is *not collected.* All data can be deleted selectively or in its entirety by the users or its *recording can be disabled* altogether.

__offen__ treats both users and operators as parties of *equal importance.* Users can expect full transparency and are encouraged to make *autonomous decisions* regarding the use of their data. Operators are enabled to *gain insights while dealing fairly* with user data.

__offen__ is currently in the concept phase and is applying for various development funds.
